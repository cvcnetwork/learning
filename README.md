We want to keep on learning and developing our craft.

This is our collection of videos and writing that we've watched and learnt from.

Now it's your turn to add something.

> everywhere. Network. Educate your client. Trust your gut. Ask for help. Make it 
> sustainable. Question everything. Have a concept. Learn to take some criticism. 
> Make me care. Use spell check. Do your research. Sketch more ideas. The problem
